1. Import Scanner:

    Imports the Scanner class from the java.util package to read user input.
2. Define the prob1 Class:

    Creates a class named prob1 to encapsulate the program's logic.
3. main Method:

    Get User Input:
    Creates a Scanner object to read input from the console.
    Prompts the user to enter an integer.
    Reads the integer using sc.nextInt() and stores it in the num variable.
    Closes the Scanner to release resources.

    Input Validation:
    Checks if the input number is within the range of 0 to 20.
    If not, prints an error message and exits the program.

    Calculate Factorial:
    Calls the calcFac method to calculate the factorial of num.
    Calculate Sum of Digits:
    Calls the calcSumOfNums method to calculate the sum of digits of the factorial.
    Print Results:
    Prints the calculated factorial and the sum of its digits to the console.
4. calcFac Method:


    Iterative Factorial Calculation:
    Initializes a res variable to 1.
    Iterates from 2 to n (the input number).
    In each iteration, multiplies res by the current iteration number.
    Returns the final value of res as the factorial.
5. calcSumOfNums Method:

    Digit Sum Calculation:
    Initializes a sum variable to 0.
    While the num is greater than 0:
    Extracts the last digit using the modulo operator (% 10) and adds it to sum.
    Removes the last digit by integer division (/ 10).
    Returns the final value of sum.
